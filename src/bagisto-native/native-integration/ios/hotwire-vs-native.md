# Hotwire vs. Fully Native Integration

When building mobile experiences for your web application, you often choose between the **Hotwire-based (Hybrid)** approach and **Fully Native** development. This guide explains why the Hotwire approach is often the best choice for modern web storefronts.

## At a Glance: Comparison Table

| Feature | Hotwire + Bridge | Fully Native (Swift/SwiftUI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development Speed** | 🚀 **Very Fast** (One codebase for web & mobile) | 🐢 **Slow** (Rebuilding all UI in Swift) |
| **Maintenance** | 🛠️ **Simple** (Update web, app updates instantly) | ⚙️ **Complex** (Must update Web, Android, and iOS separately) |
| **App Size** | 📦 **Small** (approx. 5-10 MB) | 🐘 **Large** (often 50-100+ MB) |
| **Experience** | 📱 **Native Feel** (Native navigation & UI components) | ✨ **Premium Native** (Full hardware control) |
| **Updates** | ⚡ **Instant** (OTA updates via webview) | ⏳ **Slow** (Requires App Store review for every UI change) |

## Why Hotwire is Faster and Better

### 1. Unified Logic and UI
With the Hotwire approach, your business logic, styling, and complex state management are handled in your **Next.js or React** project. The iOS app acts as a powerful container that "borrows" this UI. You don't need to write Swift code for every UI element.

### 2. Instant Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates
In a fully native app, even a small text change requires a new build and 24-48 hours of App Store review. With Hotwire, any change you deploy to your web project is immediately reflected in the iOS app without an update from the App Store.

### 3. Native Navigation Performance
Hotwire isn't a "simple iframe." It uses a **Hybrid Navigation** approach. When you tap a link, the native app intercepts it, generates a native transition, and pushes a new native view controller. This provides smooth, native-speed navigation throughout your app.

## App Size Comparison

One of the biggest advantages is the footprint of the application on the user's device.

- **Hotwire App**: Since the majority of the UI is delivered over the network (with efficient caching), the binary contains only the "Bridge" logic and core navigation. This results in a tiny app size that users can download instantly.
- **Native App**: Requires bundling all icons, fonts, and complex layout logic into the binary, leading to significant storage consumption.

## When to Choose What?

> [!TIP]
> **Use Hotwire Architecture if:**
> - You want to launch fast.
> - You have a small team or want to maintain one codebase.
> - You want to update your UI/UX content frequently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Use Fully Native if:**
> - Your app requires high-performance gaming or 3D rendering.
> - You need deep, constant background processing (e.g., fitness tracking).
> - You want to build an Offline-First application.
