# Installing Packages

To integrate the Bagisto Native framework into your web application, you need to install the core libraries and, optionally, the React-specific wrappers.

## Overview

There are two main packages:
1.  **`@bagisto-native/core`**: Required. Contains the logic, web components, and bridge bundle.
2.  **`@bagisto-native/react`**: Recommended for Next.js/React apps. Wraps core into React components.

In this section, we will cover the installation commands and dependency rules.
