# Native First

Bagisto Native prioritizes **true native mobile experiences** over simple web-wrapped solutions.

## What Does Native First Mean?

Native First means building applications that feel and behave like real native apps, not just web pages displayed in a mobile wrapper.

## Key Principles

### True Native Integration

- Access device hardware (camera, location, sensors)
- Native UI components for critical interactions
- Platform-specific behavior and design patterns

### Performance Matters

- Optimized for mobile devices
- Fast load times and smooth interactions
- Efficient resource usage

### Native User Experience

- Familiar mobile gestures and interactions
- Native sharing and notifications
- Platform-appropriate design

## Why Native First?

Users expect mobile apps to:
- Feel responsive and fast
- Access device features naturally
- Integrate with the operating system
- Provide offline capabilities

Bagisto Native delivers these expectations by putting native experiences first, while still leveraging the efficiency of web development.
