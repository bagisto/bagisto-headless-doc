# Headless First

Bagisto Native embraces a **headless-first architecture**, separating the presentation layer from backend logic.

## What is Headless First?

Headless First means building systems where the frontend (head) is decoupled from the backend, communicating through APIs.

## Key Principles

### API-Driven Architecture

- All functionality exposed through APIs
- Clean separation of concerns
- Backend independence

### Frontend Flexibility

- Choose any JavaScript framework
- Swap frontends without backend changes
- Multiple frontends from one backend

### Backend Agnostic

- Not tied to specific backend platforms
- Use any API-driven system
- Integrate with existing services

## Benefits

### Freedom of Choice

- Select the best backend for your needs
- Use existing backend investments
- Avoid vendor lock-in

### Scalability

- Scale frontend and backend independently
- Optimize each layer separately
- Add new channels easily

### Future-Proof

- Adapt to new technologies
- Migrate systems gradually
- Keep options open

## In Practice

Bagisto Native works with:
- **Bagisto Headless** - Pre-built e-commerce APIs
- **Custom APIs** - Your own backend services
- **Third-party platforms** - Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.
- **Multiple backends** - Combine different services

The headless approach ensures your native app remains flexible and adaptable as your business grows.
