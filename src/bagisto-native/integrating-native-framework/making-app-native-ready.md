# Making Your App Native-Ready

Installing the packages and the bundle is just the first step. To truly make your app "Native-Ready," you need to Integrate specific components into your application's layout and pages.

## Checklist

1.  **Register Bridge Components**: Ensure `<HotwireToast>`, `<HotwireHistorySync>`, etc., are rendered in your root layout.
2.  **Enable Native Events**: Hook up your UI buttons to trigger native actions instead of just web alerts.
3.  **Routing Safety**: Ensure your URLs work correctly both in the browser and when navigating inside the native app stack.

This section guides you through these integration steps.
