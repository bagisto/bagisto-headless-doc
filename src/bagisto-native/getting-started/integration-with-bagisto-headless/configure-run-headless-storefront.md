# Configure & Run Headless Storefront

Once you have generated your Bagisto Headless project, the next essential phase is to establish a bridge between your storefront and your backend services. This ensures that your application is dynamic and ready to serve real-time data to both web and native platforms.

## What you will do in this section:

1.  **Environment Setup**: Configure the critical connection strings required to communicate with your API.
2.  **Server Initialization**: Launch the storefront on your local development environment.
3.  **Data Verification**: Confirm that the frontend is successfully retrieving and displaying products from the backend.

::: info Importance of this Step
A correctly configured environment is the foundation for the native bridge. Without a functional API connection, the native mobile shell will have no content to render.
