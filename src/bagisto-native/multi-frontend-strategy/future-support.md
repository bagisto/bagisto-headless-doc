# Future Support

Bagisto Native is designed to be framework-agnostic at its core (`@bagisto-native/core`), but currently offers first-class support for React/Next.js.

We are actively exploring support for other popular frontend frameworks to give developers more choice.

## Roadmap

- **Vue.js**: High Priority. Given Bagisto's Laravel + Vue roots, this is a natural next step.
- **Angular**: Under consideration based on community demand.
- **Mobile-Only**: Patterns for using the Native Shell without a public web counterpart.

## Next Steps

- Explore [Vue Support](./future-support/vue.md)
- Learn about [Angular Support](./future-support/angular.md)
- Understand [Shared API Strategy](./shared-api-strategy.md)
